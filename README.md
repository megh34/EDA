The Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset provides a comprehensive view of short-term rental trends in New York City, offering valuable insights into the dynamics of the city’s rental market. This project focuses on analyzing this dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and actionable insights for key stakeholders, including hosts, guests, and policymakers. The primary objective is to use data-driven insights to help hosts optimize their pricing strategies, property management, and revenue generation, while enabling guests to identify cost-effective and desirable rental options based on location, property type, and room type. Policymakers and urban planners can leverage the findings to assess Airbnb’s impact on housing availability and neighborhood dynamics, supporting the creation of balanced regulations that promote tourism without compromising community well-being. The analysis involves examining the geographic distribution of listings across boroughs and neighborhoods, uncovering pricing disparities, and exploring the relationship between room types and pricing to reveal guest preferences. Host behavior is also analyzed to identify trends in property management, including the prevalence of professional hosting patterns. Furthermore, the project investigates availability and occupancy trends to uncover seasonal variations and the influence of minimum stay requirements on booking behavior. The methodology includes data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using tools such as Python, Pandas, Matplotlib,seaborn. Visualizations, including maps, bar charts, scatter plots, etc are used to effectively present findings. The expected outcomes include actionable insights for hosts to identify market opportunities, for guests to make informed decisions, and for policymakers to create data-driven regulations. Overall, this project aims to provide a holistic view of New York City’s Airbnb market in 2019, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions and contributing to the sustainable growth of the short-term rental market
